# Module Overview
## Module Objective 
The primary objective for this module is to learn and then apply air quality dispersion modeling using an R-based programming module, with the help of the package ‘openair’ and open-sourced air quality datasets of cities in Germany.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Understand the basics of dispersion modeling
2. Obtain and clean data sets
3. Analyze those data sets
4. Communicate results to peers and target audience members.

## Module Description
Students learn and then apply air quality dispersion modeling using an R-based programming module, with the help of the package ‘openair’ and open-sourced air quality datasets of cities in Germany.

### Data
The module uses measures of air quality in terms of concentrations of different pollutants and other particulate matter using the openair package in R.

### Platform
The module uses R.
